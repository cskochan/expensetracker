# expensetracker
An expense tracker to meet all of your financial needs

## What is this:
This expense tracker allows the user to enter (via command line) income and expenses for any date subsequent to their chosen initial starting date, with all data adjusted accordingly. It also has options for summarizing the data in various ways.

## Inspiration:
I've experimented with budgeting in the past, but attempts on paper and using Google Sheets didn't really work for me. Because of this, I've always wanted to make my own custom expense tracker.

## Prerequisites
Python3

## How it was built
This was built with VS Code

## What I learned
I learned about how to organize the functions of a program from the start, including learning how to pick the most natural parameters for a function for versatility, clarity and efficiency. Also learned about how to read, write and edit csv files.

## What's next
If I were to expand on this project I would write more options for displaying the data and create a graphical user interface.
